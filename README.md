# cubed-synth

The Rust audio code shared by the another_synth web DAW and the wgpu-cube engine:
chip emulators, module players and a modular synth engine. It is plain Rust that
builds on stable, natively and for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, so the same code can run
in a browser AudioWorklet and in a native audio callback.

| Crate | What it is |
|---|---|
| `cubed-sid` | MOS 6581/8580 SID chip (with measured 6581 revisions), a GoatTracker-style song player for the `ASID` song file, and a register-stream chip player (`stream`) |
| `cubed-ahx` | AHX / HivelyTracker (`.ahx`, `.hvl`) parser and replayer, bit-exact against `hvl_replay.c`, with a band-limited "hifi" path |
| `cubed-opl` | Yamaha OPL2/OPL3 FM chip (a port of ymfm's OPL path) and an Adlib Tracker II (`.a2m`) parser and player |
| `cubed-dsp` | The synth engine: audio graph, oscillators (analog, wavetable), envelopes, LFOs, filters, chorus, delay, reverb, convolver, compressor, limiter, EQ, voices, automation and patch loading |
| `cubed-simd` | The slice of `std::simd` the crates above use, on stable Rust |

## Features

- `wasm` (every crate): the wasm-bindgen classes another_synth's worklets use. Off by
  default; native hosts and other wasm hosts don't need it.
- `nightly-simd` (`cubed-ahx`, `cubed-dsp`): use `std::simd` itself instead of the
  stable fallback in `cubed-simd` (nightly toolchain only). Both give the same results
  lane for lane.
- `native-host` (`cubed-dsp`, on by default): the native `AudioEngine`, the
  counterpart of the wasm one.

`cubed-sid`, `cubed-ahx` and `cubed-opl` build for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` as they
are. `cubed-dsp` still needs a `getrandom` backend there (see
<https://docs.rs/getrandom/0.3/#webassembly-support>).

## Building, testing, benchmarks

```sh
cargo test --workspace
cargo test -p cubed-dsp --no-default-features --features wasm   # another_synth's configuration
cargo bench -p cubed-sid --bench sid_render
cargo bench -p cubed-opl --bench opl_render
cargo bench -p cubed-ahx --bench ahx_render
cargo bench -p cubed-dsp --bench patch_render
```

The benches render in 128-frame blocks (an AudioWorklet quantum) and report the cost
of a block against its deadline. On a Ryzen 9 5950X, AHX/HVL songs take 1–3.3 µs per
block (800–2600× realtime), and 8 held voices of a two-oscillator unison/FM patch
through a 24 dB filter take about 270 µs dry and 365 µs with chorus, delay and
reverb (10% and 14% of the 2.67 ms block). The stable SIMD fallback matches
`std::simd` on the synth. On AHX it is about 30% slower, which is 0.01% of a block.

Test fixtures live under each crate's `tests/fixtures`: AHX/HVL songs (`cubed-ahx`),
Adlib Tracker II modules (`cubed-opl`), and SID song files plus the instrument-visuals
parity fixture another_synth's TypeScript tests share (`cubed-sid`).

One test fails, as it does in another_synth:
`cubed-ahx engine::tests::the_bounded_hold_builds_every_table_the_full_hold_does`
finds that the bounded live-prewarm hold misses tables for instrument 23 of
`shattered_crystal_drops.ahx`.

## History

Extracted from another_synth's `rust-wasm` crate (`audio_processor`) at commit
`f88f9962` (v0.4.77) on 2026-10-17. Each top-level module became a crate. Changes
beyond paths and the stable SIMD fallback:

- `cubed-dsp`: the native engine no longer prints every voice's parameters on every
  block (it cost 20% of the render time); a test module that had lost its
  `use super::*` (never built under the DAW's default `wasm` feature) builds again;
  the `native_demo` and `composition` binaries, which no longer built, were left out.

Paths of the form `.ai/...` in comments refer to design notes in the another_synth
repository.
